/**
 * LogIn component - Used for managing login functionality and displaying relevant UI.
 *
 * The LogIn component is responsible for handling user login logic. It checks the user's
 * authentication status on component mount using the `useEffect` hook. The `checkAuthStatus`
 * function attempts to retrieve the current user and logs their status. If the user is not
 * signed in, it logs an error.
 *
 * This component also contains a splashOverrides object to customize the styling and content
 * of a potential splash screen, but currently, the return statement renders an empty div.
 * Future implementations can utilize this object to render a more dynamic UI based on the
 * login state or other conditions.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} - The rendered component.
